\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\mbox{\hyperlink{classGraph}{Graph}} data structure and related algorithms for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). 

This file contains the definitions of the \mbox{\hyperlink{classNode}{Node}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{classEdge}{Edge}}, and \mbox{\hyperlink{classGraph}{Graph}} classes, which are used to represent a graph and perform various algorithms such as backtracking and nearest neighbor approximation for solving the TSP.
